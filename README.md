# ImputeBench

The ImputeBench package includes two functions to benchmark imputation methods either on provided, or, on simulated data. The benchmarking, data simulation
and missingness pattern simulation protocols have been described in the accompanying paper 

R. Richter, A. Miloschewski, J.F. Tavares, M.M.B. Breteler and S. Mukherjee (2022) Benchmarking Single Imputation Methods. in preparation

Moreover, ImputeBench includes a number of plot functions to visualize observed, missing and imputed data distributions using ggplot2 or plotly. 

The functionality of ImputeBench is explained in detail in the accompanying vignette that is available in this repository.
